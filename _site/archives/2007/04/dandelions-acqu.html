  <p>It is spring and dandelion season.  I am performing an interesting experiment in artificial selection.  Every day, I go outside and pick dandelion flowers.  Dandelion flowers are practically the only vegetable waste that I do not compost.</p>

<p>I usually take a bucket and pop the flowers off, as well as the buds.  I am more likely to miss the shorter-stemmed flowers, because they are hidden below the grass, which normally needs mowing.  I am therefore selecting for dandelions whose flowers mature and go to seed in less than 1 day or whose flowers grow shorter than the grass.  It remains to be seen whether growing too short a stem is adaptive; possibly the grass will then prevent the dispersal of seeds by the wind.  If so, we can expect to see a period of stasis.</p>

<p>Even after a few days I find that I am picking shorter-stemmed dandelions.  Clearly, the later-maturing dandelions are acquiring the characteristics of those I have just picked â€“ even though they are not descended from the previous generation.  More surprisingly, the previous generation was not short-stemmed but only aspired to shortness before I nipped it in the bud.  The effect depends on distance: there appears to be an inverse-square law, with more-distant dandelions less likely to inherit the shortness of their neighbors.</p>

<p>Dandelions undergo spontaneous generation.  More surprisingly, they sometimes appear in their fully mature, adult form within less than 30 minutes:  I can scour my backyard, find not a single dandelion, and then come back 30 minutes later and easily find more than one.</p>

<p>I have developed a quantitative theory that explains how the dandelions can appear spontaneously and bring with them characteristics that their neighbors only wished they had:  Goddidit.</p>

<p>I anticipate green dandelion flowers any day now.</p>
