  <p>At the NewScientist blog, we find a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blog/shortsharpscience/2008/03/are-id-proponents-being-silenced.html">posting which raises more questions than it answers</a></p>

<p>After confirming the news that the movie is without much of any scientific content, and makes ill chosen references to Nazis, Amanda Gefter, opinion editor, describes the Q&amp;A that followed.</p>

<p>Amanda Gefter wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One woman said it was morally reprehensible to equate the death of six million Jews with Darwin. I clapped, and was astounded when nearly everyone else remained silent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then the <em>Question</em></p>

<p>Amanda Gefter wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I shot my hand up to ask a question. “The intelligent design movement has gone to great lengths to argue that intelligent design is not religion, that it’s science. And you made a whole film arguing that it is religious. How do they react to that?”</p>

  <p>“Well,” Mathis said, “I guess it makes them a little uncomfortable.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>onwards to more friendly questions from the ‘audience’</p>

<p>Amanda Gefter wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He began calling on others in the crowd, who asked friendlier questions. But Maggie and I quickly realised that we’d seen some of these people before - earlier that evening, in fact, working at the movie’s registration table. These friendly audience members worked for the film? Had Mathis planted questioners?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>seems that expelling potential critics may not have been an isolated incident</p>

<p>Amanda Gefter wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Mathis was responding, the guy asked another question, and the producer shot back, “How about you let me finish talking?” Then, a security guard for the film approached the calmly seated man and told him, “I may have to ask you to leave.”</p>

  <p>“Does anyone else see how ironic this is?” the guy asked.</p>

  <p>“Shut up!” someone shouted from the back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally the question that we all ask our ID creationist friends, a question which has remained unanswered</p>

<p>Amanda Gefter wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I asked how ID explains the complexity, but he said, “I don’t have time for this,” and walked away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was anyone else there who can confirm that this all took place?</p>
